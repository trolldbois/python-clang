# Clang Python package for PyPI

This repository builds and releases the [clang package on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/clang/) .

The wheel is built from the LLVM libclang python binding source code directly. Thanks @nightlark for the 2025 refresh of the build process.

This package does not contain binary files for the libclang library, only the python bindings.


## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install clang
```

Or for a specific version:

```bash
pip install clang==19
```

## License

This repository follows the [license agreement](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/LICENSE.TXT) of the LLVM project, see Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception.

## Release SOP
